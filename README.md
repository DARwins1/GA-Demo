# GA-Demo
A program that demonstrates the capabilities of a genetic algorithm. This program runs both a genetic algorithm implementation and a brute-force algorithm to solve an increasingly complex set of knapsack problems.
To run the program, compile it into a JAR executable file, and run it on the command line with `java -jar Knapsack.jar <nItems> <nSpecimens> <nGenerations>`.
nItems: Item limit for the knapsack problems. Each generated problem will have 1 additional item until it reaches this limit (inclusive).
nSpecimens: Number of specimens to use in each genetic algorithm generation.
nGenerations: Number of generations to run before terminating each genetic algorithm.
Command-line arguments are necessary! This program is a simple demonstration and has no error checking. All the inputs should be integers!
